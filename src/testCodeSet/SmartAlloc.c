/* Smartalloc.c       Copyright Clinton Staley 1991
 * 
 * Smartalloc provides an malloc version which checks for several possible
 * errors:
 *
 * 1. Failure of malloc or calloc call for any reason.
 * 2. Attempt to free memory not allocated by malloc/calloc, or already freed.
 * 3. Writing past the end or before the beginning of allocated memory.
 * 4. Failure to free memory by some point in the program.
 * 5. Use of data after it has been freed.
 * 6. Assumption that data returned by malloc is set to 0.
 *
 * Use smartalloc by including smartalloc.h in any file that calls malloc,
 * calloc or free.  Also, compile smartalloc.c along with your other .c files.
 * If you make any of errors 1-3 above, smartalloc will report the error
 * and the file/line on which it occured.  To find out if you have left
 * memory unfreed, call report_space().  If any unfreed memory is
 * outstanding, report_space will return the number of bytes of unfreed
 * memory.  If no memory is unfreed, report_space returns 0.
 * Use of freed data is "detected" by writing garbage into the freed data,
 * which will usually generate a runtime fault if the data is later used.
 *
 * All rights to this package are reserved by its author.  Duplication of
 * source or object code is permitted only with the author's permission.
